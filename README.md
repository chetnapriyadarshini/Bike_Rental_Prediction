## General Information
- This project uses multiple linear regression to make prediction for a bike rental company to predict the demand for the bikes based on past data of years 2018 and 2019
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. 
  The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end,
  and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- Understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
  The company wants to know:
	Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
	How well those variables describe the bike demands
- The dataset is a csv file of 732 rows of daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors like year, weather, month, holiday, weekday, weekend etc over the years 2018 and 2019.
